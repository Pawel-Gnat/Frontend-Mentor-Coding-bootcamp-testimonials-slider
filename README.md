## My process

Java Script:

1. Created variables,
2. Set my previous and next slide function,
3. Coded loop function to use my fade-in class (with opacity: 1),
4. Created event listeners with one switch statement on my keyboard left and right arrow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge took me 9 hours. I struggled with my poor responsive design (setting position absolute on my images isn't a good idea to shrink or grow my slider properly) and java script. JS code took me 4 hours and I coded my html again trying to have better structure (2 hours work more), so I would complete this task within 3 hours, if I knew how to solve all my problems before :).

I learned how to use switch statement with key events and easy loop function.
